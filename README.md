## 🧠 About Me

I like working with data because it makes me think slowly and carefully.

Most of my work lives somewhere between **data science, machine learning, analytics, and data engineering**. I enjoy starting from raw, unstructured data and slowly shaping it into something useful, whether that is a model, a dashboard, or a system someone can actually rely on.

I care a lot about things making sense.  
Clear assumptions. Clean pipelines. Honest evaluation.

I am still learning, still experimenting, and still figuring out what “good” looks like in real-world systems, but that curiosity is what keeps me here.
