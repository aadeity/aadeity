## 🧠 About Me

Hey there! Talking about me , I like working with data and i think thats the most accurate and shortest summary of all my works .
Talking about my works,  most of my work lives somewhere between **data science, machine learning, analytics, and data engineering**. I enjoy starting from raw, unstructured data and slowly shaping it into something useful, whether that is a model, a dashboard, or a system someone can actually rely on.

I care a lot about things making sense.  
Clear assumptions. Clean pipelines. Honest evaluation.

I am still learning, still experimenting, and still figuring out what “good” looks like in real-world systems, but that curiosity is what keeps me here.
