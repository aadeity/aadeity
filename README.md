## 🚀 What I Focus On

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: extracting insights, building dashboards, storytelling with data  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: classical ML, model evaluation, feature engineering  
- 🧱 **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines, batch + streaming, cloud data stacks  
- 🧠 **AI Systems**: ML pipelines, experimentation, and model robustness  

I care deeply about **clarity, reproducibility, and real-world impact**, not just model accuracy.
